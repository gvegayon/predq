# predq

This is an example of a shiny app for the USC IMAGE group. To run this app, besides of having `R` and `shiny`, you'll need to install the R package [`polygons`](https://github.com/USCBiostats/polygons), which is on development.

Also, for this to run, you'll need `devtools` ~~and `readr`~~, since the app uses this to install missing dependencies, inparticular, `polygons` and `readr`.

The shiny app, located in `example1`, can be found in https://gvegayon.shinyapps.io/predq. The shiny app in `example0` is a meaningless but simple example using the `app.R` file.
